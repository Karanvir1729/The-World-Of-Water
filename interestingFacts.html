  Improve irrigation and agricultural practices
Some 70 percent of the world’s freshwater is used for agriculture. Improving irrigation can help close supply and demand gaps. In certain cases profligate irrigation practices meant for an earlier era has weakened the ability of farmers to provide food and fiber to a growing world. Examples include the Murray-Darling basin in Australia, Central Asia’s Aral Sea, and the American Southwest. Although new technology has become an appealing solution, global water experts like Peter Gleick note that in some cases, such as the agricultural systems in California, success stories can happen by improving what’s already in place.

      <p>This accounts to 1 in 10 people on earth living without fresh water.</p>
     <h3> 2. Women around the world spend a combined total of 200 million hours hustling for water</h3> 
     <p id= "numberOfLives" ></p>
     <p>That is equal to 3125000 life times just spent collecting water.(One image represents 3125 people).</p>
    <h3> 3. Everyday 800 children die from diarrhea attributed to poor water and sanitation</h3> 
    <img src="images/contaminatedWater.jpg", id='contaminatedWater', width = 40%, style="display:block;margin:auto"> 
    <h3> 4. Only 3% of earth's water is fresh.</h3> 

    <h3> 5. 2.3 billion people live without water for basic sanitation</h3>
    <h3>6. 90% of all natural disasters are water-related
    <h3>7. Meat eaters have much larger water-footprint as compared to vegans/ vegitarians.For example, to produce one pound of beef is 1,799 gallons of water. As a comparison, the water footprint of soybeans is 216 gallons.
    </h3>

    <p>The indistrulization of meat results in water scarcity in cuntries with poor infrastructure. </p>
    
    <h3>8. Climate change results in water cycle being distrupted. This results in dramatic floods and water scarcity in the same region
    </h3>

    <div style="position:absolute;background-color: blue; width:5%; height:5%;" id="highlight"> Most affected area</div>
   
    <p>This kind of water stress is more evident near the equator. </p>
   

    <h2>Solutions</h2>  
    <h3>Promoting sustainable water usage practices</h3>
    <h3>Developing Infrastructure and facilities for the sanitization of water</h3>
    <h3>Improving agricultural practices such as growing crops that need less water</h3>
    <h3>Recycling and reusing waste water</h3>
    <h3>More than 70% of the Earth is covered in water and theoretically everyone has access. However, its not the access thats an issue its access to clean water. Which can be solved through sponsoring water wells, and filteration devices</h3>
